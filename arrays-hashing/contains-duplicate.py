# Instructions: 
# Given an integer array, nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in array
# Return false if every element is distinct 

# Pseudocode: 
# For Loop (x in nums)
# Iterate through each value in nums
# If x = some value in nums, return false
# If x != some value in nums, return true 

# Solution
